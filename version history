V 0.1: initial commit. A mostly functional CLI set of randomizers, with a couple things on the to-do list still before I declare it 1.0 and begin work on the 2.0 GUI version.

V 0.2: Fixed an incomplete part of the code for the random outfit on the character generator. I focused so much on the harder part, I forgot to do the easy half. Revised location generator to no longer compile results into a sentence, but a set of keywords like the character randomizer. I like this set-up better. More upfront about throwing the content at the user to interpret it:

"Genre: paranormalpunk
Location: shopping center
Social Structure: a team
Species: hairless dwarves."

Rather than "A paranormalpunk shopping center populated by a team of hairless dwarves."

Hairless dwarves is such a perfect combination possibility. So is paranormalpunk, really.

Also added a check for legless species, after not noticing that I was reading from the wrong variable for an hour, resulting in all True results from the function.

V 0.3: I sat back and did lots of minor things.

Altered many inline comments, removed a few blank results that found their way into my lists due to how I populated them with copied online lists that I find-and-replaced to fit into the code. Renamed some variables to be clearer about their contents among the lists.

Added a bit to the to-do list, and.. really, I worked on revising and improving the lists in general this time, that's where most of the effort went.

Had the idea to make a list of lists to manage singular/plural forms of words, then realized I could cut out the singular form of that particular list by adding a single word to the location randomizer, simplifying the work immensely.

May keep in mind the idea of a list of lists for later, though. Say, if I get my list of greek words, so I can pull a random result from the main list, get ["arachne", "spider"] and then pull from the proper indexes to use both the Greek and English forms of the word.

Tweaked the random location generator to give more varried results, especially in silly mode.

Altered the randomizer that adds "punk" to the end of a random word to make a genre so that if 1 or fewer results were requested of it, it gives a single string result.

Attempted to start the game generator in the hopes of ticking that off and declaring this V1.0 so that I could begin on GUI development, but I'm still undecided on how it should function enough to begin. I have some ideas and am getting there, though.

v 0.4: got to cracking shortly after the last update, and added more lists, and begun the random game generator.

More or less, I did some more idle work on the lists, and added 3 new lists in preparation for the game generator, as well as spent a lot of time considering how the game generator will work.

I feel my gut feelings have served me well through the other randomizers and getting the right combination for specific and general to make many possible combinations, but produce coherent ideas from them. So I spent hours working through those gut feelings.

Currently I feel I am close with the description on the readme, but that I'm not quite there.
