# randomizers
A practice project of randomizing random things I think would be amusing or practical.

Project goals:
2.0 - Expand to GUI with PyQT5, executeables and maybe web integration.
3.0 - Expand to phone app version.

The randomizers are as follows:

Magic 8-ball: returns a random result from a list of all Magic 8-ball answers.

Random phrases: pulls a random line from a text file. Currently just a couple dumb things I shoved in, could be any text. Mostly thought I'd put in random quotes.

Random location: Comes up with a random location, with guidance on setting, style, and what lives there.

Random genre: I want to populate the list with more words, but taking the trend of terms like "steampunk, cyberpunk, dieselpunk, ETC" I made a randomizer that added "punk" to a random list of words so that I could have more genres to work with. It was my intention to replace "punk" with other words as well, but the results for what the genre could possibly be became too esoteric.

Random character: generates a random character with a species, age, gender, outfit style, outfit, personality, two colors, quirk, and if chosen to turn on, a kink. Found that last one kinda amusing.

Random game: a random game prompt. Select between light/medium/heavy modes. Light = basic prompt to run with like what you would get from most game jams. Medium = Light + random setting genre for aesthetic style. Heavy = Medium + randomized idea for a unique gameplay style. Really, it's just a game mechanic and a word to describe it and leave you to interpret it, but it's the best I could come up with when just sitting down to get it done.

Stepping away from the project for maybe a month to do something else.

Current goals:
1. The randomizers could always use more lists, or more items in the lists. Expanding upon the content and options is always a perpetual to-do item.
2. The lists of accessories in particular could use lots of work.
3. Work on adapting the code for GUI.
4. If I expand into basic Python machine learning libraries, could I scour, say, imdb of its films using a script, create designated datasets for the film summary, quotes section, actors sections, ETC, and see what it comes up with when I run several AI processes designated to specific sections, creating a complete profile for a fictional film? An idea for later, possibly after I hit 2.0. Machine Learning is on the periphery of packages I wish to try, and that sounds like an amusing one.
5. Add a random name generator that uses a combination of vowels and consonants to generator a name, particularly for the characters. On the more advanced end, have multiple varieties for different feels for how the name works. I suspect this will be good Regex practice.
6. Consider adding super-specific species variations, like a "were-something" set of animal people, add more specific types for general stuff like "angelic/demonic/insectoid" to say things like "ant insectoid" or "imp demon" or "cupid angel" ETC. Just a consideration for how to greatly increase the scope of the random species. Maybe save it for after I implement classes for organizing lists, so I can make a single object that I can call general/specific species from separately.
7. After GUI is implemented, add a random facts bar that will show a new message every couple of minutes to say stuff like "there are len()+1 number of y" and other random trivia about the program and the stuff in it.
8. I noticed "mittens" were under the silly list for hand accessories, likely because I hadn't been singling out weather-appropriate clothing at the time of making that list, so perhaps go back and scour all the silly lists for more winter/summer exclusive clothing.
